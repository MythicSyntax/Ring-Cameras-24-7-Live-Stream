<h1>Ring Cameras - 24/7 Live Stream Video</h1>

Hey there! In this Readme file, you will learn how to use the **Ring Play Live Video Continuously** app.

## ‚ùî Problem Description
**Ring does not allow exceeding more than 10 minutes to live stream your Ring cameras. After approximately 10 minutes, the live stream will abort, and the user needs to manually "reconnect" to the live stream of their camera.**

**This is a big problem for users like me, because we want to see the live stream 24/7 on our screens (Fire Tablet, Android Smartphone, or any other Android-based device).**

## üõà Solution
### **Ring Cameras -  24/7 Live Stream (old Name: Ring Play Live Video Continuously)!**

**This app auto-reconnects the live stream as soon as it gets disconnected. On the different devices tested, there was a "short break" of approximately 1 second between each disconnect. No more user action is required to keep the stream alive „ÉÑ.**

## üõà All you need to do is:

### Step 1
**Download the app and install it on your Android device.** <span role="tooltip" aria-label="Download raw file" id=":r44:" class="Tooltip__TooltipBase-sc-17tf59c-0 izAlVj tooltipped-n"><button data-component="IconButton" type="button" aria-label="Download raw content" data-testid="download-raw-button" data-hotkey="Control+Shift+S" data-size="small" data-no-visuals="true" class="types__StyledButton-sc-ws60qy-0 fCIOmi"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" role="img" class="octicon octicon-download" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16" fill="currentColor" style="display: inline-block; user-select: none; vertical-align: text-bottom; overflow: visible;"><path d="M2.75 14A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 1 12.25v-2.5a.75.75 0 0 1 1.5 0v2.5c0 .138.112.25.25.25h10.5a.25.25 0 0 0 .25-.25v-2.5a.75.75 0 0 1 1.5 0v2.5A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 13.25 14Z"></path><path d="M7.25 7.689V2a.75.75 0 0 1 1.5 0v5.689l1.97-1.969a.749.749 0 1 1 1.06 1.06l-3.25 3.25a.749.749 0 0 1-1.06 0L4.22 6.78a.749.749 0 1 1 1.06-1.06l1.97 1.969Z"></path></svg></button></span>

### Step 7
**All done. Open your Ring app and enjoy a 24/7 live stream.**
