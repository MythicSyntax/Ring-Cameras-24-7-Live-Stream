<h1>Ring Cameras - 24/7 Live Stream Video</h1>

Hey there! In this Readme file, you will learn how to use the **Ring Play Live Video Continuously** app.

## ‚ùî Problem Description
**Ring does not allow exceeding more than 10 minutes to live stream your Ring cameras. After approximately 10 minutes, the live stream will abort, and the user needs to manually "reconnect" to the live stream of their camera.**

**This is a big problem for users like me, because we want to see the live stream 24/7 on our screens (Fire Tablet, Android Smartphone, or any other Android-based device).**

## üõà Solution
### **Ring Cameras -  24/7 Live Stream (old Name: Ring Play Live Video Continuously)!**

**This app auto-reconnects the live stream as soon as it gets disconnected. On the different devices tested, there was a "short break" of approximately 1 second between each disconnect. No more user action is required to keep the stream alive „ÉÑ.**

## üõà All you need to do is:

### Step 1
**Download the app and install it on your Android device.** 
<a href="ring-play-live-video-continuously.apk" title="Download Now!">Download App</a>
### Step 2
**Get a license key!**
**Please contact me for a license. Currently, I'm building a website to automate this process.**

### Step 3
**Start the app on your Android device.**

### Step 4
**Enter the license key you just purchased.**

### Step 5
**Click on the button "Start / Stop Ring Live Video Service".**

### Step 6
**Your settings will now open. Go to "Accessibility -> Services / Installed Apps" and enable the app "Play Ring Live Video Continuously". This will be the toggle to turn the service on and off.**

**Hints:**
- **On some devices/Android versions, the name of the settings on your device may be different ("Either it's 
Accessibility -> Services" 
OR 
"Accessibility -> Installed Apps
or something similar to the both examples above").**
- **Newer Android versions require the app permissions to be set before enabling the Accessibility Service. If so, please head over to your Device- "Settings -> Apps -> Ring: Play Live Video Continuously -> 3 Dots -> Allow Special Rights".**

### Step 7
**All done. Open your Ring app and enjoy a 24/7 live stream.**

## ‚ö† Supported Languages (13.05.2024)
**English, German (More Language Support on request. Use my Contact Information below)

Please make sure to have one of these supported languages running on the target device.**

## ‚ö† Recommended
- **If you plan to use this app on your daily phone, you can toggle the service off and on (as mentioned above in Step 6).**
- **You can add a shortcut to toggle the service on and off. Just go to your Device- "Settings -> Accessibility -> Ring Play Live Video Continuously" and enable "Ring Play Live Video Continuously shortcut".**
- **I recommend to use the live video in full-screen mode (its not required but recommended).**
