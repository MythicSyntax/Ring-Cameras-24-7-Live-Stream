Hey there! In this Readme-File you will learn how to use this Ring Play Live Video Continuously-App.

❔ Problem-Discription:
- Actually, Ring does not allow to exceed more than 10 Minutes to live stream your Ring cameras. 
After approx. 10 Minutes, the live stream will abort, and the user needs to "reconnect" to the live stream of his camera.

This is a big Problem to Users like me, because we want to see the live stream 24/7 on our screens (Fire Tablet, Android Smartphone or any other Android Based Device)

🛈 Solution:

- Ring Play Live Video Continuously!

- This App auto-recoonects the live stream as soon as it gets disconnected. On the different devices tested on, there was a "short break" between every disconnect of approx. 1 Second.
There is no more User action requiered to keep the stream alive ツ.


🛈 All you need to do is:

- Step 1: Download the App and Install it to your Android-Device
- Step 2: !!! Get a license key !!! Please contact me for a License! Actually i'm building the Website to automatically do this process for me.
- Step 3: Start the App on your Android Device
- Step 4: Enter the license key you just purchased
- Step 5: Click on the Button "Start / Stop Ring Live Video Service"
- Step 6: Your Settings will now open. Now go to "Accessibility -> Services / Installed Apps" and enable the App "Play Ring Live Video Continuously"
  This will be the toggle to turn On and Off the Service - more later on!
  Hints:
  - On some Devices/ Android Versions, the Name of the Settings are different ("Accessibility -> Services" OR "Accessibility -> Installed Apps").
  - Newer Android Versions require the App-Rights to be set BEFORE BEING ABLE to enable the Accessibility Service. If so, please head over to "Settings -> Apps -> Ring: Play Live Video Continuously -> 3 Dots -> Allow Special Rights" 
  
  Step 7: All done. Open up your Ring App and enjoy 24/7 live stream.



⚠ Supported Languages (13.05.2024): English, German -> !!! Please make sure to have one of this supported Languages running on the target device. !!!
